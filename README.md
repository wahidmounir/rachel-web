# rachel-web
This is the code that runs the rachel.worldpossible.org website.

# setup

There is an Apache2 conf snippet in the scripts directory.

There is a MySQL schema in the scripts directory.

You can set your MySQL db/user/pass and a unique COOKIE_KEY in lib/O2G/Tools.pm

# api
There is a minimalist open API:

http://rachel.worldpossible.org/cgi/json_api_v2.pl

This URL will return a JSON associative array of all modules -- the key is the "moddir" (eg: "en-wikipedia" for the English language Wikipedia module), and the data is a limited subset of the data useful for displaying a list.

You can also pass a moddir to the API like this:

http://rachel.worldpossible.org/cgi/json_api_v2.pl?moddir=en-wikipedia

This will return all the data associated with the en-wikipedia module.
